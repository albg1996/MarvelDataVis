For a quick over view of the project please see: __marvel-character-sceen.pdf__

Here is the overview of the files I worked on:

__characters2.csv__- the csv file created to store all of the necessary data for the visualization

__project2.html__- the main html file where the visualization is displayed (currently only works locally, no official website)

__marvel-character-screen.pdf__- the write up for this project, contains detail on all aspects of the project
